# Breast-Cancer-Risk-Prediction

Data used is the Breast Cancer datasets is available machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. 

Problem:
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed. 

Expected Outcome:
Given breast cancer results from breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:
1= Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
0= Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent

Goal:
It is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period.  To achieve this we have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input
